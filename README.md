Shortened history of the planet ( planet alias " Supernova planet ". initial name, not original name ),
-
-

in previous ( still not sure the authentic original location, maybe " purple star solar system " or " violet star solar system " due " universe disaster matters " alias " Supernova " ), the planet was original residence " blue star Solar system " ( code: A0V, sample reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_index ). somehow, the planet suffered the Supernova ( universe disaster ) and then the planet become enter into the yellow star solar system. once upon a time, the planet was accidentally get hit ( alias " big bang " ) by another planet. and then the nature disaster ( massive flood ) was happened. suddenly, somehow the planet was went out from the yellow star solar system ( around 10 till 100 years ago. 10 till 100 years without " star " ). and then the planet was entered ( the status right now ) into the yellow star solar system again. the peoples ( the peoples who original residence galaxy of Supernova planet) are standing still wait for the planet come back/return into the " blue star solar system " again nor " authentic original star solar system " until now.

About the page ( project reference: https://github.com/tempatmaingameonline/XML ),
- this page will develop by many/much peoples from my original residence planet, especially the peoples whom original eye balls colour " blue " ( also yellow hair ). In every section ( ie: section I ~ Python tool ~, section II ~ python security ~, etc ), it will fill with at least ( minimum ) 100000000000000 scripts/softwares/creations/designs.
- why the penalty 100000000000000 scripts/softwares/creations/designs ?
answer: because we ( i, my original father, my original mother, my teams/groups, etc. original residence: not that planet and galaxy ) were involved disturb their planet ( included the ecosystem and habitation ) while the planet suffering " Supernova " ( universe disaster ) and " massive flood " ( nature disaster ) in the past.
- this page able use by another peoples ( source: whole universe. the peoples who ever disturbed the Supernova planet ) for pay and fulfill their penalty

- ~ the original owner of stuffs is the Supernova planet. also, those stuffs part of the public ( whole universe ) assets and properties ( alias " Public Facility ". meant: " Public facility " which " provided " by the Supernova planet )
- ~ critical warning !!!
